		<p><b>About PickPix</b></p>
		PickPix is a Wallpaper app that provides its users with HD Wallpapers for their iOS Devices. For any concers you can email us at pickpixapp@gmail.com, we are also open for any suggestions.

		<p><b>How to use the app</b></p>
		The app has categories for the convinience of its users to navigate to their favourite wallpaper category. In addition, if you like a wallpaper and do not wish to save it instantly to your photos album you can press the "star" on the top right of the wallpaper and that wallpaper will be saved into your favourite wallpapers in the app. To navigate to your favourite wallpapers click on the menu icon (bottom left) and go to the Favourites from the tab bar.
		<br><br>
        Rather than swiping you could select the collection view which is located on the top right next to the "star" button where you can view many wallpapers of the selected category at once and navigate faster.
        <br><br>
        While viewing a wallpaper you can double tap on that wallpaper in order to hide the buttons to get a better vision of the image. If you wish to share the image you could tap on the share icon which is located on the bottom right of the wallpaper and share it with friends and family.
        <br><br>
        To save the wallpaper you can click the big button in the middle where you need to give access to your photos in order for the app to save the image to your photos album.
        <br><br>
        If you wish to remove the Ads from the app you could use our in-app purchase feature. It will remove all the ads from the app, meaning no ad will ever interupt you again.
        <br><br>
        Please keep the app updated to the latest version for better perfomance and new features :)
